To that end, they hope to develop an Android/iOS application that uses augmented reality (AR) to enhance the device\u2019s camera with fun and informative content about Canada\u2019s nature. At the moment, the application is not funded. Our product will show potential investors that such an application is possible, hopefully securing funding for the Aquatic Biosphere Project to further develop the application.</p> <p>When a user first opens the product, they will confirm their location in order to ensure the accuracy of the displayed information. The product will then open the device camera, and the user will be free to use it to scan their environment. When the user brings a relevant object into the camera view, the product will augment the object with the appropriate AR objects. Note that the product will only be tailored to environments within the University of Alberta North Campus.</p>"},{"location":"#product-documentation","title":"Product Documentation","text":"<ul> <li>To view the User Manual: click here</li> <li>To view the project job description: click here.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-glossary","title":"Project Glossary","text":"<ul> <li>augment - add additional virtual objects into the camera view so that the objects look as if they are there in 3d space</li> <li>camera view - the live camera feed of a device that is made visible on the device\u2019s screen</li> <li>device - a handheld computing device with an integrated camera and a screen, running the android/ios operating system</li> <li>application - software running on a device; in the context of the summary, it refers mostly to the proposed but undeveloped future application</li> <li>product - the proof-of-concept application currently being developed</li> <li>AR object - augmented-reality object; fun or educational information, which may come in the form of 3d models, lines of text, images, among other mediums</li> <li>environment - a set location with visible objects that remain fairly consistent; this will be used to consistently test different camera views</li> <li>surface - flat plane in the real world on which the AR objects are augmented on.

for the user interface of the presentation layer, and the main logic of our app will be contained in Unity3D as well. The presentation layer will be built with Unity's built in UI Toolkit, and the Maps SDK in Unity will allow the Google Maps API to be used in the business layer to assist location detection. We also will use Unity3D to access camera, detect surfaces, and build all AR related functionality through the AR Foundation Framework that allows adaptation to both Android and iOS without further changes. We will use Firebase Firestore as the persistence layer for accessing AR models, and a Firestore database for storing 3D models and their information that we will use for the AR experience. Our Firebase project and Unity will be integrated with Firebase Unity SDK, where it will be configured for both Android and iOS. The backend of the project will be hosted on Cybera RAC. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"pages/software/#uml-class-diagram","title":"UML Class Diagram","text":"<p>The Aquatic Biosphere app is comprised of three distinct scenes: HomeScreen, UserLocation, and ARCamera. Navigation between these scenes is facilitated by the Navigation class, which provides convenient methods for accessing the succeeding and preceding scenes from any given scene. The HomeScreen scene serves as a welcoming introduction to the app and directs the user to the Aquatic Biosphere project page. Moving forward, the UserLocation scene employs Google's maps API to confirm the user's location. Finally, the ARCamera scene is responsible for managing all the AR models that appear on the screen, utilizing the ObjectManager class to accomplish this task. Users can access information about these models through a pop-up that is spawned by the ModelInfoView class, and this information is pulled from our database, which is managed using the DBHandler class. Throughout the app, 3-dimensional vectors play a prominent role, and these vectors are represented using our custom Vector3 class.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"pages/software/#sequence-diagram","title":"Sequence Diagram","text":"<p>The sequence diagram features the four most important interactions in our app: login, location recognition, camera view, and information view. From opening the app, users may choose to login. After which, all users must set their location either automatically through a built in maps API, or manually enter their location if the GPS is incorrect. Once location is set, users will be navigated to their camera view that allows them to point their camera at aquatic objects in order to see an AR of said object on screen. Users may view information about objects by clicking on them, where they may choose to navigate further to external Wiki sites through embedded links.
